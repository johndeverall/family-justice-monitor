    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Family Justice Monitor NZ is an initiative in formation, working to establish an independent organisation dedicated to monitoring and analysing the impact of New Zealand's family justice system on families, children, and society. We believe that transparent, evidence-based oversight is essential for ensuring the family justice system serves the best interests of children and treats all families fairly.</p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>We are currently:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Establishing governance structures and seeking founding board members</li>
        <li>Scoping our first research activities and building partnerships</li>
        <li>Developing our funding model to ensure independence</li>
        <li>Engaging with families, professionals, and community stakeholders</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At this stage we are a volunteer-driven initiative. As resources and structures develop, we will expand our capacity to conduct independent research and advocacy.</p>

    <h2>Why This Work Matters</h2>
    <p>The family justice system makes decisions that profoundly affect the lives of children and families. While the system operates with good intentions, there is limited independent oversight of its actual outcomes and impacts. Questions remain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are family justice decisions achieving their intended outcomes for children?</li>
        <li>How do court processes affect the wellbeing of children and parents?</li>
        <li>Are there systemic biases or gaps in how justice is delivered?</li>
        <li>What are the long-term social and economic impacts of family justice decisions?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These questions matter to every New Zealand family, yet comprehensive, independent monitoring has been lacking. We are working to fill that gap.</p>

    <h2>Our Intended Approach</h2>

    <h3>Evidence-Based</h3>
    <p>We will combine rigorous quantitative research with qualitative case studies, ensuring our findings reflect both statistical patterns and individual experiences.</p>

    <h3>Independent & Transparent</h3>
    <p>We are committed to maintaining independence from government, legal institutions, and single-interest advocacy groups. We will publish our methodology, funding sources, and potential conflicts of interest openly.</p>

    <h3>Culturally Responsive</h3>
    <p>We recognise that the family justice system affects different communities differently, particularly MƒÅori and Pacific peoples. Our work will be informed by te Tiriti o Waitangi and centre the voices of those most impacted.</p>

    <h3>Solutions-Focused</h3>
    <p>While we will identify problems, our ultimate goal is constructive: to help build a family justice system that truly serves the best interests of children and treats all families with fairness and dignity.</p>
