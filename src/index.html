        <h1>Monitoring the Impact of New Zealand's Family Justice System</h1>
        <p>An initiative in formation to provide independent research and monitoring of New Zealand's family justice system</p>
        <p>Every year, thousands of New Zealand families navigate the family justice system during some of the most difficult times of their lives. While the system aims to protect children and resolve disputes fairly, its impact on families and society deserves careful, independent scrutiny. We are working to build an independent mechanism to shine a light on how the family justice system is working—and where it needs to improve.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Initiative Status</h2>
    <p class="text-center"><strong>Family Justice Monitor NZ is an initiative in formation.</strong> We are currently establishing governance structures, seeking founding committee members, and scoping our first research activities. Our goal is to create a truly independent, evidence-based organisation to improve transparency and accountability within New Zealand's family justice system.</p>
    <p class="text-center">At this stage we are a volunteer-driven initiative. As resources grow, we will expand to include paid research and outreach roles.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Research & Monitor</h3>
            <p>We aim to collect and analyse data on family justice outcomes, processes, and their long-term effects on children, parents, and whānau. Our evidence-based approach will combine rigorous research methodology with the lived experiences of affected families.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Why We Exist</h2>
    <p>The family justice system makes decisions that profoundly affect the lives of children and families. While the system operates with good intentions, there is limited independent oversight of its actual outcomes and impacts. Questions remain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are family justice decisions achieving their intended outcomes for children?</li>
        <li>How do court processes affect the wellbeing of children and parents?</li>
        <li>Are there systemic biases or gaps in how justice is delivered?</li>
        <li>What are the long-term social and economic impacts of family justice decisions?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These questions matter to every New Zealand family, yet comprehensive, independent monitoring has been lacking. We are working to fill that gap.</p>
