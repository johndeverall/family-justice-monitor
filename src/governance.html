    <h1>Governance Structure</h1>
    <p>Family Justice Monitor NZ will be established as an <strong>Incorporated Society</strong> under the Incorporated Societies Act 2022, with plans to subsequently apply for charitable status with Charities Services.</p>
    <p>This structure ensures democratic governance, accountability to members, and alignment with New Zealand's legal framework for not-for-profit organisations.</p>

    <h2>Incorporated Society Structure</h2>

    <h3>Founding Members</h3>
    <p>We are currently recruiting founding members who will form the initial Society. A minimum of 10 members is required to incorporate. Founding members will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adopt the Society's constitution and rules</li>
        <li>Elect the inaugural Committee</li>
        <li>Establish the organisation's operational framework</li>
        <li>Guide the initial strategic direction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Committee (Governance Body)</h3>
    <p>Once the Society is incorporated, members will elect a Committee to provide strategic oversight and ensure we remain true to our mission while maintaining the highest standards of independence and integrity.</p>

    <h3>Intended Committee Composition (7-9 officers)</h3>
    <p>We are seeking to bring together diverse expertise and perspectives through our founding membership:</p>

    <h2>Why This Structure Matters</h2>

    <h3>Democratic Governance</h3>
    <p>The Incorporated Society structure ensures democratic accountability to members and transparent decision-making processes.</p>

    <h3>Balance & Independence</h3>
    <p>Our intended Committee structure deliberately balances multiple perspectives—legal expertise, lived experience, cultural knowledge, and research rigour—ensuring no single viewpoint dominates our work.</p>

    <h3>Lived Experience at the Centre</h3>
    <p>We believe those who have navigated the family justice system must have a voice in governance, not just in consultations. Their insights are invaluable to understanding real-world impacts.</p>

    <h3>Cultural Responsiveness</h3>
    <p>Māori and Pacific families are disproportionately represented in family justice proceedings. Our governance structure will ensure their perspectives inform our work from the ground up.</p>

    <h3>Expertise & Credibility</h3>
    <p>Our Committee's legal, research, and child welfare expertise will ensure our findings are rigorous, credible, and useful to policymakers and practitioners.</p>

    <h3>Pathway to Charitable Status</h3>
    <p>Once incorporated, we will apply for charitable status with Charities Services, enabling tax-deductible donations and demonstrating our commitment to public benefit.</p>
