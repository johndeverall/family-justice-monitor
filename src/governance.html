    <h2>Why This Structure Matters</h2>

    <h3>Balance & Independence</h3>
    <p>Our Board deliberately balances multiple perspectives—legal expertise, lived experience, cultural knowledge, and research rigor—ensuring no single viewpoint dominates our work.</p>

    <h3>Lived Experience at the Centre</h3>
    <p>We believe those who have navigated the family justice system must have a voice in governance, not just in consultations. Their insights are invaluable to understanding real-world impacts.</p>

    <h3>Cultural Responsiveness</h3>
    <p>Māori and Pacific families are disproportionately represented in family justice proceedings. Our governance structure ensures their perspectives inform our work from the ground up.</p>

    <h3>Expertise & Credibility</h3>
    <p>Our Board's legal, research, and child welfare expertise ensures our findings are rigorous, credible, and useful to policymakers and practitioners.</p>
