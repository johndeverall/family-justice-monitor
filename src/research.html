    <h2>Intended Research Focus Areas</h2>

    <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Court Processes & Outcomes</h3>
            <p>How does the family justice system function in practice? We will examine waiting times, consistency of decision-making, access to justice, and whether outcomes align with stated goals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Impact on Children</h3>
            <p>What are the short and long-term outcomes for children affected by family justice decisions? We will look at wellbeing indicators, educational outcomes, mental health, and stability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Parental Experiences</h3>
            <p>How do parents experience the family justice process? We will examine accessibility, fairness perceptions, legal representation issues, and the impact on parent-child relationships.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Cultural & Demographic Patterns</h3>
            <p>Are there disparities in how different communities experience the family justice system? We will analyse patterns across ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geography, and other factors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>System Costs & Efficiency</h3>
            <p>What are the broader social and economic costs associated with family justice proceedings? We will examine both direct costs and downstream impacts on mental health services, social support systems, and productivity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Legal Industry Practices</h3>
            <p>How do lawyers, psychologists, and other professionals interact with the system? We will examine professional practices, financial incentives, and their impact on family outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Intended Methodology</h2>

    <h3>Mixed Methods Approach</h3>
    <p>We will combine quantitative analysis of court data and social outcomes with qualitative research including interviews, case studies, and surveys of affected families.</p>

    <h3>Rigorous Standards</h3>
    <p>All research will undergo ethical review and follow established social science research protocols. Where possible, we will seek peer review of our findings.</p>

    <h3>Lived Experience Integration</h3>
    <p>We will centre the voices of those affected by the family justice system, ensuring research questions and interpretations reflect real-world experiences.</p>

    <h3>Independent Verification</h3>
    <p>We will seek to verify findings through multiple data sources and welcome academic collaboration and review.</p>
